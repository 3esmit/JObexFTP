	1. About Project
	----------------
	What is JObexFTP?
	JObexFTP is a Java implementation of Obex Client protocol under Siemiens/Cinterion AT specification aimed to work with TC65 and TC65i modules.
	Its a fully opensource library (and application) to transfer files from/to obex server.
	You can use it in any J2SE application to enable java communication to module without third party app. You can also use it as a MES in unsupported cinterion plataforms like Linux.
	It can be easily adapted to similar devices.

	2. Dependences
	--------------
	This software uses, obviously Java, and RxTx library.
	RxTx is a native library that helps Serial (and Parallel) communication under Java.
	Its freely avaliable in http://rxtx.qbang.org/ it also has a debian package that dosent works in modern linux but there is a project to fix that here http://github.com/chrisdew/rxtx

	3. How to get JObexFTP working?
	-------------------------------
	- Download and Install RxTx library. Please follow the instructions detailed in the file you downloaded.
	- Download or compile JObexFTP.jar
	- Download emulator shellscript
	- Put both file together. I recommend it under WTK/bin/ where Windows WTK bins are.
	- Configure Profile IDE to see the WTK using the emulator shellscript.
	- Go to console, type 'dmesg | tail', see the output, connect device, type that command again and look out for a new USB device. In my computer it get identified as ttyACM*, but depending your distro it can be ttyUSB* or ttyS*. Once you found, keep that name in mind and edit emulator shellscript, go to first line and change de 'ttyUSB?' to your distro needs, in my case I change to ttyACM?, so the line get like this:
	ttypath=`ls /dev/ttyACM? | tail -n 1`
	- Install gtkterm. If you want to use other serial term, change the command in emulator script.

	4. Troubleshotting
	------------------
	- Check if you installed the RxTx in the right place, maybe you installed under a not used anymore JRE. I recommend you install in all JRE, and also in JDK's JRE, so it will be flawless.
	- Check if you configured correctaly the ttypath in the emulator script.
	- Are the two files in the same directory?
	- Is your IDE sending the right parameters?
	- If you still could not get it running, send detailed install process and error messages to 3esmit at gmail dot com.
