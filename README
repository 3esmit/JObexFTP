1. About Project
What is JObexFTP?
JObexFTP is a Java implementation of Obex Client protocol under Siemiens/Cinterion AT specification aimed to work with TC65 and TC65i modules, but can perfecly work in any OBEX device with simple adaptation.
It is developed as an opensource substitute of Cinterion Module Exchange Suite (MES) and also as a library to give Java applications MES capabilities. 
The project is mainly developed by Linux users but it works in Windows too, as 98% of the project is cross-plataform.

2. Dependences
Java 1.6 and RxTx library.
RxTx is the only library that implements serial communication under java that is cross plataform. Its freely avaliable in http://rxtx.qbang.org/
