1. About Project
What is JObexFTP?
JObexFTP is a Java implementation of Obex Client protocol under Siemiens/Cinterion AT specification aimed to work with TC65 and TC65i modules.
Its a fully opensource library (and application) to transfer files from/to obex server.
You can use it in any J2SE application to enable java communication to module without third party app. You can also use it as a MES in unsupported cinterion plataforms like Linux.
It can be easily support similar devices.

2. Dependences
This software uses, obviously Java, and RxTx library.
RxTx is a native library that helps Serial (and Parallel) communication under Java.
Its freely avaliable in http://rxtx.qbang.org/ it also has a debian package that dosent works in modern linux but there is a project to fix that here http://github.com/chrisdew/rxtx
